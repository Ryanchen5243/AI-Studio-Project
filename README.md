# Geothara Riverbed Reconstruction Project

This repository contains the work conducted by Geothara Team 1A during the Fall 2023 AI Studio program at Cornell Tech. The project, led by Solomon Vimal, CEO of Geothara, focuses on leveraging data science for climate risk management associated with water and energy.

## Project Overview

Climate change poses significant challenges globally, affecting river systems and, consequently, water and energy security. This project aims to enhance our understanding of riverbeds by curating a large dataset of river measurements. The focus includes addressing climate risks such as floods, droughts, energy reliability, and environmental conservation.

## Key Components

- **Business Context:** Describes the importance of the project in addressing climate risks and introduces Geothara's mission in utilizing data science.

- **Data:** Highlights the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics and HEC-RAS simulation software for modeling river hydraulics. G01 files provide geometric data crucial for analysis.

- **Data Processing:** Introduces a Python script developed to handle G01 files, extracting relevant information and representing it in a matrix format for streamlined analysis.

- **Approach:** Outlines the team's strategy in creating a sophisticated river cross-section model, involving regression modeling and the use of third-order polynomials.

- **Lessons Learned:** Reflects on the challenges faced during the project, emphasizing the meticulous nature of river data cleaning and the importance of assumptions in model generation.

- **Acknowledgements:** Expresses gratitude to key stakeholders, including Break Through Tech, Geothara, and team members, for their collaboration and support.
